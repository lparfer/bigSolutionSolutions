### Twitter sentiment analysis for tweets regarding Spanish airlines

The main goal of this project was to train a classification model able to classify each twit in three distinct groups:  ‘positive’, ’negative’ or ‘neutral’.

To do so, we started making a description of how happy or unhappy the clients were depending on which airline they used.

The project has been distributed in 3 phases:

1.- Data set analysis

2.- Data cleaning and preparation

3.- Model selection
